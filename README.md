# The Sailing Skill
A plugin that lets you test the basic mechanics of a potential new skill designed by myself and GentleTractor.

For an overview of the skill concept and instructions on how the plugin works, see [this 15 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8PLxz7S6Vo).

For a deeper dive into the skill, see [this multi-hour ramble](https://youtu.be/YrmISJQ38cU) between GentleTractor and I.
